# Sorting Algorithms 
Sorting is about ordering a list of objects. It's a very important thing in programming, The different sorting algorithms are a perfect showcase of how algorithm design can have such a strong effect on program complexity, speed, and efficiency. this repository contains All sorting algorithms implemented in Javascript.
